# MachineLearningRepository
 A machine learning portfolio for CS 4375

## Portfolio Component 0

Overview of Machine Learning Document viewable [here](OverviewofML.pdf)

## Portfolio Component 1

C++ Data Exploration
A simple C++ program to perform data exploration on a CSV file.
Assignment document can be found [here](DataExploration/Data_Exploration.pdf)

C++ code found [here](DataExploration/DataExploration.cpp)

## Portfolio Component 2

Linear Models
An exploration of linear regression, logistic regression, and Naive Bayes algorithms using R notebooks. The linear regression notebook can be found [here](LinearModels/Regression.pdf) while the source can be found [here](LinearModels/Regression.Rmd). The classification using logistic regression and Naive Bayes notebook is located [here](LinearModels/Classification.pdf) while the source may be found [here](LinearModels/Classification.Rmd)

## Portfolio Component 3

C++ Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
Two simple programs demonstrating an implementation of Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. The source code for the Logistic Regression may be found [here](ML_FromScratch/LogRegression.cpp) while the source for Naive Bayes is located [here](ML_FromScratch/NaiveBayes.cpp). An explanation of the output is found [here](NL_FromScratch/ML_Scratch_Explanation.pdf).

## Portfolio Component 4

Searching for Similarity Group Project.
My portion of this project was to work on PCA and LDA data reduction for a classification data set. The R notebook can be found [here](SearchingForSimilarity/PCA_LDA.pdf)
