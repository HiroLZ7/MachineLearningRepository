# MachineLearningRepository
 A machine learning portfolio for CS 4375

## Portfolio Component 0

Overview of Machine Learning Document viewable [here](OverviewofML.pdf)

## Portfolio Component 1

C++ Data Exploration
A simple C++ program to perform data exploration on a CSV file.
Assignment document can be found [here](DataExploration/Data_Exploration.pdf)

C++ code found [here](DataExploration/DataExploration.cpp)

## Portfolio Component 2

Linear Models
An exploration of linear regression, logistic regression, and Naive Bayes algorithms using R notebooks. The linear regression notebook can be found [here](LinearModels/Regression.pdf) while the source can be found [here](LinearModels/Regression.Rmd). The classification using logistic regression and Naive Bayes notebook is located [here](LinearModels/Classification.pdf) while the source may be found [here](LinearModels/Classification.Rmd)

## Portfolio Component 3

C++ Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
Two simple programs demonstrating an implementation of Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. The source code for the Logistic Regression may be found [here](ML_FromScratch/LogRegression.cpp) while the source for Naive Bayes is located [here](ML_FromScratch/NaiveBayes.cpp). An explanation of the output is found [here](NL_FromScratch/ML_Scratch_Explanation.pdf).

## Portfolio Component 4

Searching for Similarity Group Project
My portion of this project was to work on PCA and LDA data reduction for a classification data set. The R notebook can be found [here](SearchingForSimilarity/PCA_LDA.pdf)


## Portfolio Component 5

Machine Learning with SKLearn
A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the use of the SKLearn python library to build logistic regression, decision tree, and neural network models. The notebook can be found [here](SKLearn)

## Portfolio Component 6

Image Classification 
A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of Keras and Tensorflow to create an image classifier with three different types of deep neural network models. The architectures used include a sequential model, a convolutional model, and a transfer learning model. The notebook can be found here [here](ImageClassification)

## Final Summary

The opportunity to build this portfolio has allowed me to develop new skills that I would not have been introduced to beforehand. The protfolio is comprised of projects in R, C++, and Python, where I got to learn about many of the basic machine learning algorithms and how to use them to achieve usable results. Being exposed to the projects in this portfolio has inspired me to learn more about how machine learning can be applied to solve different problems. Ideas for future projects include using deep neural networks to try to predict trends in securities markets, and also learning about natural language processing to combine with programming languages. The skills I have been exposed to in this portfolio are Python and R programming, data exploraation and wrangling, and Tensorflow and Keras. I have also gotten to further practice my soft skills which include team work and presentations.
